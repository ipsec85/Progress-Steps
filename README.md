# Progress Steps

Utilizes HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JS. Layout is similar to something you might find
on a site where you must fill out information such as text fields or radio buttons,
and progress to different input information. There are 4 steps but more can be included
by simply adding more circle class divs within the main container.

Can be utilized in a shopping cart setup, data entry form, or survey questionnaire.
